# fuzzel - Wayland-native app launcher

`xbps-install fuzzel`

## Overview

Fuzzel is a lightweight, Wayland-native application launcher similar to rofi's drun mode.
This package provides a unified app launcher that combines:

- Native Linux desktop applications (from .desktop files)
- PWA applications (from Vivaldi)

## Files

- `home/.config/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini` - Main configuration with Tokyo Night theme
- `home/.config/fuzzel-scripts/app-launcher.sh` - Script that merges native apps + PWAs

## Keybinding

- `mod+d` - Open app launcher (handled by sway keybindings)

## PWA Support

PWA .desktop files are read from `~/.local/share/applications/vivaldi-*-*.desktop`
and merged with native desktop entries. Custom icons are assigned to known PWAs.

## Custom Icons

| App      | Icon |
| -------- | ---- |
| ChatGPT  | 󱜸    |
| Discord  | 󰟮    |
| WhatsApp | 󰊫    |
| Gmail    | 󰊫    |
| YouTube  | 󰗃    |
| Telegram | 󰀲    |
| Spotify  | 󰓇    |
| Reddit   | 󰌀    |

All other apps use the fallback icon from the icon theme.
